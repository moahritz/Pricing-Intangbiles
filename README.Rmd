## Pricing-Intangibles

To Do:

Download LIQ Factor

Write 'ReadMe's' for every auxiliary File

Find out how to produce them with plots (-> maybe straight KNitR them?)

Do the LIQ ~ F_INT, & LIQ ~ FF regressions

Fucking get behind how to fix this fucking shit of a whore piece of git connection without suing github desktop those bunch of motherless sloths. die -> did it (will keep this as a memento tho)

Show the difference of the Factors when RMW is divided by be, or by be_int

MY BROTHER IN CHRIST: we forgot about the market factor. (did we?) -> check this straight after coming back from the doc!

List of test plots:

[ ] All the recreated fama french factors with the originals.

All the intangible factors with the recreated fff.

The two different rmw_int factors

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r hml_reproduction, echo=FALSE, out.height= "50%" }
hml_plot

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r reproduction, message = FALSE, results = 'asis', echo = FALSE}
library(stargazer)
stargazer(model_smb, model_hml, model_rmw, model_cma, type = "html")
```

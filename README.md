test line from RStudio.

**To Do:**

-   Download LIQ Factor

-   Find out how to produce them with plots (-\> maybe straight KNitR them?)

-   Do the LIQ \~ F_INT, & LIQ \~ FF regressions

-   Fucking get behind how to fix this fucking shit of a whore piece of git connection without suing github desktop those bunch of motherless sloths. die -\> did it (will keep this as a memento tho)
